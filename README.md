# Showcase boilerplate

Boilerplate code to get started on a wink showcase's front-end. Copy this over and start a new repo. Deploy using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) by [setting the source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) to the `master` branch.

Packages from wink can be [bundled](http://browserify.org/) and used [in the browser](https://winkjs.org/blog/browser-search.html). If you need a server, consider deploying an API method [serverlessly](https://github.com/winkjs/showcase-serverless/).

## What is included?
